# Terminal-Overflow



The command line is a powerful tool, but is not very user friendly. This project will give you an edge and save you time when you need to find, put together, and run a command. Features:

* Visual Experience
* Mouse & keyboard navigation
* Customize and link helper containers to understand commands and options
* Leverage multiple command data sources: history, recommended, and saved commands
* Designed for use in terminals such as Google Cloud Console
